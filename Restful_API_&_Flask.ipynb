        "1. Authentication\n",
        "Use authentication to verify the identity of users or clients.\n",
        "2. Authorization\n",
        "Use authorization to control what authenticated users can do.\n",
        " 3. HTTPS Only (TLS)\n",
        "Always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.\n",
        "Never send API keys, tokens, or passwords over HTTP.\n",
        "4. Input Validation & Sanitization\n",
        "Validate all incoming data using libraries like:\n",
        "marshmallow\n",
        "pydantic (via FastAPI, or manually in Flask)\n",

        "SQL injection\n",
        "XSS (if returning data to HTML views)\n",

        "Prevent abuse (e.g., DDoS, brute-force attacks).\n",
        "6. Error Handling and Hiding Internals\n",
        "Avoid exposing internal errors or stack traces to users.\n",
        "7. Secure API Tokens and Secrets\n",

        "8. CORS Control\n",
        "Use Flask-CORS to explicitly allow trusted origins\n",
        "9. Use a Security-Focused Deployment\n",
